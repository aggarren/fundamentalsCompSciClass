Case 1
Input: +* 12 2
Output example: 1+5*2=12 2+2*3=12
Explanation: tests to ensure a combination of a + and * outputs correctly and that two combinations are returned

Case 2
Input: *+ 17 3
Output example: 2*4+9=17 5*2+7=17 2*7+3=17
Explanation: tests to ensure the reverse of the above combination also outputs correctly and that three combinations are returned

Case 3
Input: /- 1 2
Output example: 3/1-2=1 6/2-2=1
Explanation: tests to ensure a combination of a / and - outputs correctly and that two combinations are returned

Case 4
Input: -/ 3 1
Output example: 9-3/2=3
Explanation: tests to ensure the reverse of the above combination also outputs correctly and that one combination is returned

Case 5
Input: +/ 2 1
Output example: 6+4/5=2
Explanation: tests to ensure a combination of + and / outputs correctly and that one combination is returned

Case 6
Input: /+ 8 1
Output example: 9/3+5 = 8
Explanation: tests to ensure the reverse of the above combination also outputs correctly and that one combination is returned

Case 7
Input: *- 80 2
Output example: 9*9-1 = 80
Explanation: tests to ensure the 1 combination of * and - outputs correctly and that a message saying there were not enough equations is also outputted

Case 8
Input: -* 9 1
Output example: 5-4*9=9
Explanation: tests to ensure the reverse of the above combination also outputs correctly and that one combination is returned
