Test Cases

Case1
Input: 2 1 10
Output example: ++ 0 + 1 + 9 = 10
       		. . .
		** 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
Explanation: tests for combinations of operators


Case2
Input: 2 2 -150
Output example: ++ Not enough equation possibilities
       		. . .
		** Not enough equation possibilities
Explanation: tests for several digits and not enough possibilities

Case3
Input: 3 1 -10 
Output example: +++ Not enough equation possibilities
       		. . .
		*** Not enough equation possibilities
Explanation: tests for negative answer and several operators 

Case4:
Input 3 3 300 
Output example: +++ 0 + 0 + 0 + 300 = 300
       		. . .
		*** 0 * 0 * 1 * 300 = 300
		*does load just takes a while be patient*
Explanation: tests for several digits and several operators

Case5:
Input 4 2 0
Output: ++++ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
	. . .
	**** 0 * 0 * 0 * 0 = 0
Explanation: tests to make sure that 4 operators work and that an answer of zero works

Case6:
Input 2 1 -2
Output example: ++ Not enough equation possiblities
       		. . .
		** Not enough equation possibilities
Explanation: tests for negative answer
