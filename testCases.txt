Test Cases

Case1
Input: 2 2 ** 150 3
Output example: 5*3*10 = 150
       		3*5*10 = 150
		10*3*5 = 150
		10*5*3 = 150
Explanation: tests for 1 and 2 digit numbers in equation


Case2
Input: 2 2 ** -150 3
Output example: Not enough possible equations
Explanation: tests for negative answer and no possible combinations

Case3
Input: 3 1 +-- -10 4
Output example: 0+1-2-9 = -10
	0+0-1-9 = -10
	Not enough possible equations
Explanation: tests for negative answer with some possible combinations, but not enough
	     also tests for combination of different operators

Case4:
Input 3 3 +++ 300 2
Output example: 100+100+100 = 300
	50+150+100 = 300
Explanation: tests for enough possible equations and 3 digit numbers in equation

Case5:
Input 4 2 ++++ 0 2
Output: 0+0+0+0 = 0
	Not enough possible equations
Explanation: tests to make sure that 4 operators work and that it returns one possible equation and then says there are no more

Case6:
Input 2 1 -- -2 2
Output example: 0-0-2 = -2
       		0-1-1 = -2
Explanation: tests for negative numbers
