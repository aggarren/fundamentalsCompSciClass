Test Cases:

SIMULATION MODE:
./Project3 s 10 10 1
	   Checks for equal numbers of time and tellers and 1 iteration
./Project3 s 30 10 1
	   Checks for way more time than tellers and 1 iteration
./Project3 s 10 2 2
	   Checks for less tellers than time and more than 1 iteration

Explanation:
This test case tests for
     - 5 customers
     - duration of 5
     - 2 tellers
     - no customers come in at last unitTime
     - one customer needs more time being served than duration
     - a few wait times but mostly 0
     - a few lengths but mostly 0
     - idle times
     - what a cust does in method 2 when all lines are empty

==========
No. of iterations: 5
Simulation Duration: 63
Average Simulation Time: 12.6
Average number of customers served: 10
Average service time for customers: 15

Explanation:
This test case tests for
     - 10 customers
     - time of 10
     - 3 tellers
     - no customers come in at one of the unitTimes
     - customer comes in at the last unitTime
     - long waits
     - long queues
     - time goes longer than duration
     - optimize based on tellers as multiple instances of 0 wait and length
     - one teller is not used at all
